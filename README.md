#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the application of the engineering principles, methods and tools to design and maintain high quality aplication systems.
It is important because it enales the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life. Its impacts are felt in so many sectors including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Software engineering: the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
2. Programming languages: It brought about the development of programming languages such as Fortran
3. Agile methodologies: the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Collecting  and documenting needs and system requirements of users
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) that must be completed before moving to the next. It’s best suited for projects with well-defined requirements and low flexibility, like construction or hardware development.

Agile is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. It’s ideal for projects with evolving requirements, such as software development, where ongoing customer feedback is crucial.

Examples:

Waterfall: Building a bridge, where requirements and steps are clear from the start.
Agile: Developing a mobile app, where features and user needs may change during the project.







Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: seeing to the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
  





Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Both Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) are Software engineering tools enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools, and automated testing capabilities.

Example of IDEs are Visual Studio and Eclipse

Example of VCS are  Git and Subversion

  



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
The strategies to overcome these challenges are:
Changing Requirements
Tight Deadlines
Technical Debt
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Testing individual components of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Testing helps identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about giving instrcctions or crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models such as Chat GPT, Gemini etc
Prompt engineering equips us with a  skill to ask clear and specific questions, so the AI understands exactly what we need.

Think of it as 



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why 


An example of a vague prompt: What is software engineering?
Improved version: What is software engineering? Explain it to the beginners living in Lagos, Nigeria.
